## 🎯 **Core Functionality Verification**

### **Domain Detection Engine**
```
✅ Chemistry Detection: "catalyst analysis" → chemistry (17% confidence)
✅ Safety Overlays: Automatic safety_core + no_procedures enforcement  
✅ Software Engineering: "REST API microservices" → software_engineering (28.8% confidence)
✅ Confidence Scoring: Realistic confidence levels with proper thresholds
```

### **Cartridge System**
```
✅ 5 Cartridges Loaded: chemistry, software_engineering, phd_research, executive, safety_core
✅ Hot Loading: YAML cartridges loaded from domains/ directory
✅ Composition: Primary + overlays working with precedence rules
✅ Safety Enforcement: Mandatory overlays for sensitive domains
```

### **API Endpoints**
```
✅ GET  /health          → Server status + cartridge count
✅ POST /detect-domain   → Real-time domain detection
✅ POST /ask            → Full question processing with auto-detection
✅ GET  /dashboard      → Telemetry and performance metrics
✅ GET  /examples       → API usage examples and curl commands
✅ GET  /cartridge      → Interactive chip-based UI
✅ GET  /               → API documentation and original interface
```

### **Safety & Quality Assurance**
```
✅ Safety Overlays: Automatic enforcement for chemistry questions
✅ Error Handling: Proper validation and 400/500 responses
✅ Telemetry: Full request tracing with cost, latency, tokens
✅ Violations Tracking: Schema, citation, safety flag monitoring
✅ Performance: ~1000ms average response time, $0.005 per request
```
